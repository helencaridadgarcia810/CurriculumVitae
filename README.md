## Education

* 2010-2015 **Degree: Informatic Sciences Engineering**; Universidad de las Ciencias Informáticas (Havana, Cuba)  
*Thesis: Development of a Mobile application to couple all major web services of the University of Informatics Sciences for Android devices.* More information available [here](https://humanos.uci.cu/2015/05/11/campus-uci-una-navaja-suiza-para-la-universidad-de-las-ciencias-informaticas/)

## Work Experience

* **Feed on Ideas: Feedback system for Web applications. (2018-present, [aleph].engineering): 3 engineers, 1 project manager**

  Online platform able of opening discussions, topics, votes and real-time feedback of what users think about your Web application. The system is being built from scratch creating a `GraphQL API` using `python` and `Django` as backend technologies, and `Angular 5` for the frontend page.  

* **Feed Parser: Library for parsing RSS resources. (2018, Own project): 1 engineer**

  Open source Library for parsing XML following the Really simple syndicate standard. It was written using `Java` and `Kotlin` programming languages and `Gradle` for building the project. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/ygpedroso/feedParser) in the code repository.

* **Toy Story: Single page application for Germany renting toys company (2018, [aleph].engineering-MeineSpielzeugkiste): 4 engineers, 1 designer, 1 project manager**

  Frontend application for handling the onboarding process of renting toys all through the system. A single page application was developed using `Javascript` on top of `React`, `Redux`, `Jest` and `Semantic-UI` as a styling framework. As result of the development, an open source `npm` package was created by the team as a `Redux middleware`. More information about this package can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cuban-engineer/redux-storage-middleware).

* **Casabe I'M ON FIRE: Android Media app for advertising Cuban artist music (2017-2018, [aleph].engineering): 3 engineers, 1 designer**

  The mobile app was developed using the `Android SDK` and both `Java` and `Kotlin` programming languages. The musician tracks were protected using a `xor` encryption algorithm to achieve both security and good user experience in matters of speed. 

* **Web-based Content and Cases(CMMN) Management System (2015-2017, Cuba, Government Entity): 10-15 engineers, 1 project manager**

  An application for managing customizable content, and creating dynamic workflows was created from scratch using `Groovy` language on top the `Grails` web framework for creating a `Rest API` in the backend, and a single page application using `AngularJS` for the frontend, `Bootstrap` and `Angular Material` as styling framework for first and second versions respectively. Since a great know-how about `Oracle` among the engineers' team, only implementation for this kind of database was created. 

## Technical Experience

* **Programming Languages**
  * **Javascript:** This is one of my favorites languages since I love working on frontend applications, I have 4 years of experience working with it and related extensions such as `CoffeeScript` and `Typescript`. Always trying to keep up to date with the latest `ECMAScript` features.  

  * **Java:** 4 years of experience using `Java` mainly inside the Android environment. I really love the language and feel comfortable using Dependency Injection libraries such as `Dagger` and mocking tools such as `Mockito` for unit testing.

  * **Python:** 2 years of experience using `Python` and I am every day loving it more and more, as well as improving my skills. Mainly I tend to use it along with `Django` framework and for scripting.

  * Also know  **CSS3**, **HTML5**, **Angular**, **React**, **Kotlin**, **Groovy**.

* **Other Technologies**
  * **git:** I use git everyday. I could not be able to work without it. Version control is very important to me and I believe in [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) way of doing commits.
  * **Docker:** Docker reduces the gap between the developer environment and the staging and production scenario. I've used Docker to test and deploy software and it's a technology I use almost every day. I'm also familiar with docker-compose.
  * **Jenkins:** Jenkins gives you the possibility of making Continuous Integration of almost any project, which ensures the quality of it in every single build, also allows to deliver Continuous Deployment to the final user which is essential for faster feedback and agile development. I can not start a project without setting a Jenkins configuration.
  * **Testing:** Every application might have bugs, but testing reduces the time spent trying to find them, as well as a major quality insurance. Whether it is `unit tests` or `e2e tests`, I like to have at least an 80% of code coverage.
